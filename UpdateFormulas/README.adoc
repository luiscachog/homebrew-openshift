# How-To Update the Formulas

###ALL WORK SHOULD BE DONE IN THIS DIRECTORY

In this directory review and update any values in vars.yml you need. Pay particular attention to these:
```yaml
odo_version: "v2.3.0"
rose_version: "1.1.1"
serverless_version: "0.22.0"
```

If it is a major version change like 4.8 to 4.9 then you might want to do the following:
```bash
git mv ../Formula/openshift-client.rb ../Formula/openshift-client@4.8.rb
git mv ../Formula/openshift-install.rb ../Formula/openshift-install@4.8.rb
git mv ../Formula/opm.rb ../Formula/opm@4.8.rb
```

From this directory run the following command to update the files:
```bash
ansible-playbook main.yaml
```

To test changes to a set of tasks use (replace rosa with whatever name):
```bash
ansible-playbook -e what=rosa test.yaml
```
